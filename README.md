# Velock

The semester project "Velock" focuses on the development of a smart bicycle lock. If the bike lock is tampered with, the user automatically receives a notification via a companion app. LoRaWAN technology is used for communication and data transmission. Within the app, the user can view the current location of the bike, ensuring enhanced control and security.
